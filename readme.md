# Download Organizer
Sorts files in your download folder by extension, creates folders for each automatically.
**Don't forget to check if the directory in the code matches yours!**
If it finds files, it will print a progress bar.
If it doesn't find any files to sort in the given directory, it will output a blank line.
**Of course you can use this for other directories, but keep in mind it only sorts by extension.**
